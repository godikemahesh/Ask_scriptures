  "Arjuna is His devotee and His friend. The purport of this is that Bhagavad-gétä\nis a treatise which is especially meant for the devotee of the Lord. There are\nthree classes of transcendentalists, namely the jïäné, the yogé and the bhakta,\nor the impersonalist, the meditator and the devotee.

  "Supreme Personality of Godhead not only by himself but by authorities like\nNärada, Asita, Devala and Vyäsadeva. These are great personalities who\ndistribute the Vedic knowledge as it is accepted by all äcäryas.

First of all, the science of God is explained and then the constitutional\nposition of the living entities, jévas. There is éçvara, which means the\ncontroller, and there are jévas, the living entities which are controlled. If a\nliving entity says that he is not controlled but that he is free, then he is insane.\nThe living being is controlled in every respect, at least in his conditioned life.",
  "So in the Bhagavad-gétä the subject matter deals with the éçvara, the supreme\ncontroller, and the jévas, the controlled living entities. Prakåti (material\nnature) and time (the duration of existence of the whole universe or the\nmanifestation of material nature) and karma (activity) are also discussed. The\ncosmic manifestation is full of different activities. All living entities are\nengaged in different activities. From Bhagavad-gétä we must learn what God is,",
  "what the living entities are, what prakåti is, what the cosmic manifestation is,\nhow it is controlled by time, and what the activities of the living entities are.\nOut of these five basic subject matters in Bhagavad-gétä it is established that\nthe Supreme Godhead, or Kåñëa, or Brahman, or the supreme controller, or\nParamätmä—you may use whatever name you like—is the greatest of all. The\nliving beings are in quality like the supreme controller. For instance, the Lord",
  "has control over the universal affairs of material nature, as will be explained in\nthe later chapters of Bhagavad-gétä. Material nature is not independent. She is\nacting under the directions of the Supreme Lord. As Lord Kåñëa says,\nmayädhyakñeëa prakåtiù süyate sa-caräcaram: “This material nature is working\nunder My direction.” When we see wonderful things happening in the cosmic\nnature, we should know that behind this cosmic manifestation there is a",
  "controller. Nothing could be manifested without being controlled. It is childish\nnot to consider the controller. For instance, a child may think that an\nautomobile is quite wonderful to be able to run without a horse or other animal\npulling it, but a sane man knows the nature of the automobile’s engineering\narrangement. He always knows that behind the machinery there is a man, a\ndriver. Similarly, the Supreme Lord is the driver under whose direction",
  "everything is working. Now the jévas, or the living entities, have been accepted\nby the Lord, as we will note in the later chapters, as His parts and parcels.

We are trying to control nature, as presently we are trying to control\nspace or planets, and this tendency to control is there because it is in Kåñëa.\nBut although we have a tendency to lord it over material nature, we should",
  "know that we are not the supreme controller. This is explained in\nBhagavad-gétä.\nWhat is material nature? This is also explained in Gétä as inferior prakåti,\ninferior nature. The living entity is explained as the superior prakåti. Prakåti is\nalways under control, whether inferior or superior. Prakåti is female, and she is\ncontrolled by the Lord just as the activities of a wife are controlled by the\nhusband. Prakåti is always subordinate, predominated by the Lord, who is the",
  "predominator. The living entities and material nature are both predominated,\ncontrolled by the Supreme Lord. According to the Gétä, the living entities,\nalthough parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, are to be considered prakåti.\nThis is clearly mentioned in the Seventh Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä. Apareyam\nitas tv anyäà prakåtià viddhi me paräm/ jéva-bhütäm: “This material nature is\nMy inferior prakåti, but beyond this is another prakåti—jéva-bhütäm, the living\nentity.”",

Above these modes\nthere is eternal time, and by a combination of these modes of nature and under\nthe control and purview of eternal time there are activities, which are called\nkarma. These activities are being carried out from time immemorial, and we\nare suffering or enjoying the fruits of our activities. For instance, suppose I am",
  "a businessman and have worked very hard with intelligence and have amassed\na great bank balance. Then I am an enjoyer. But then say I have lost all my\nmoney in business; then I am a sufferer.

  "Devotional activities are never to be considered material, although sometimes\nit appears that devotees are engaged just like ordinary men.

The material conception of life makes us very eager\nto receive honor from others, but from the point of view of a man in perfect\nknowledge—who knows that he is not this body—anything, honor or\ndishonor, pertaining to this body is useless.

As for actual advancement in spiritual science, one should have a test\nto see how far he is progressing. He can judge by these items.",
  "Nonviolence is generally taken to mean not killing or destroying the body,\nbut actually nonviolence means not to put others into distress. People in\ngeneral are trapped by ignorance in the material concept of life, and they\nperpetually suffer material pains. So unless one elevates people to spiritual\nknowledge, one is practicing violence. One should try his best to distribute real\nknowledge to the people, so that they may become enlightened and leave this",
  "material entanglement. That is nonviolence.\nTolerance means that one should be practiced to bear insult and dishonor\nfrom others. If one is engaged in the advancement of spiritual knowledge,\nthere will be so many insults and much dishonor from others. This is expected\nbecause material nature is so constituted. Even a boy like Prahläda, who, only\nfive years old, was engaged in the cultivation of spiritual knowledge, was\nendangered when his father became antagonistic to his devotion. The father",
  "tried to kill him in so many ways, but Prahläda tolerated him. So there may be\nmany impediments to making advancement in spiritual knowledge, but we",
  "Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l.

As for acceptance of the\nspiritual master, that is essential, because without the instruction of a bona\nfide spiritual master one cannot progress in the spiritual science. One should",
  "approach the spiritual master with all humility and offer him all services so\nthat he will be pleased to bestow his blessings upon the disciple. Because a\nbona fide spiritual master is a representative of Kåñëa, if he bestows any\nblessings upon his disciple, that will make the disciple immediately advanced\nwithout the disciple’s following the regulative principles. Or, the regulative\nprinciples will be easier for one who has served the spiritual master without\nreservation.",
  "reservation.\nCleanliness is essential for making advancement in spiritual life. There are\ntwo kinds of cleanliness: external and internal. External cleanliness means\ntaking a bath, but for internal cleanliness one has to think of Kåñëa always and\nchant Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare\nRäma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. This process cleans the accumulated dust of\npast karma from the mind.\nSteadiness means that one should be very determined to make progress in",
  "spiritual life. Without such determination, one cannot make tangible progress.\nAnd self-control means that one should not accept anything which is\ndetrimental to the path of spiritual progress. One should become accustomed\nto this and reject anything which is against the path of spiritual progress. This\nis real renunciation. The senses are so strong that they are always anxious to\nhave sense gratification. One should not cater to these demands, which are not",

Unintelligent commentators on the Bhagavad-gétä try to divert the",
  "mind of the reader to other subjects, but there is no other subject in\nBhagavad-gétä than devotional service.\nFalse ego means accepting this body as oneself. When one understands that\nhe is not his body and is spirit soul, he comes to his real ego. Ego is there. False\nego is condemned, but not real ego. In the Vedic literature (Båhad-äraëyaka\nUpaniñad 1.4.10) it is said, ahaà brahmäsmi: I am Brahman, I am spirit. This “I",

A brähmaëa is considered to be the spiritual master of the\nthree other sections of a society, namely, the kñatriyas, the vaiçyas and the",
  "çüdras, but a sannyäsé, who is on the top of the institution, is considered to be\nthe spiritual master of the brähmaëas also. For a sannyäsé, the first\nqualification should be fearlessness. Because a sannyäsé has to be alone without\nany support or guarantee of support, he has simply to depend on the mercy of\nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead. If one thinks, “After I leave my\nconnections, who will protect me?” he should not accept the renounced order",
  "of life. One must be fully convinced that Kåñëa or the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead in His localized aspect as Paramätmä is always within, that He is\nseeing everything and He always knows what one intends to do. One must thus\nhave firm conviction that Kåñëa as Paramätmä will take care of a soul\nsurrendered to Him. “I shall never be alone,” one should think. “Even if I live\nin the darkest regions of a forest I shall be accompanied by Kåñëa, and He will",
  "give me all protection.” That conviction is called abhayam, fearlessness. This\nstate of mind is necessary for a person in the renounced order of life.\nThen he has to purify his existence. There are so many rules and\nregulations to be followed in the renounced order of life. Most important of all,\na sannyäsé is strictly forbidden to have any intimate relationship with a\nwoman. He is even forbidden to talk with a woman in a secluded place. Lord",

  "Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.\nclass, but it is a stricture imposed on the sannyäsé not to have close\nconnections with women. One has to follow the rules and regulations of a\nparticular status of life in order to purify his existence. For a sannyäsé, intimate\nrelations with women and possession of wealth for sense gratification are\nstrictly forbidden. The ideal sannyäsé was Lord Caitanya Himself, and we can",
  "learn from His life that He was very strict in regards to women. Although He is\nconsidered to be the most liberal incarnation of Godhead, accepting the most\nfallen conditioned souls, He strictly followed the rules and regulations of the\nsannyäsa order of life in connection with association with woman. One of His\npersonal associates, namely Choöa Haridäsa, was associated with Lord\nCaitanya along with His other confidential personal associates, but somehow",
  "or other this Choöa Haridäsa looked lustily on a young woman, and Lord\nCaitanya was so strict that He at once rejected him from the society of His\npersonal associates. Lord Caitanya said, “For a sannyäsé or anyone who is\naspiring to get out of the clutches of material nature and trying to elevate\nhimself to the spiritual nature and go back home, back to Godhead, for him,\nlooking toward material possessions and women for sense gratification—not",
  "even enjoying them, but just looking toward them with such a propensity—is\nso condemned that he had better commit suicide before experiencing such\nillicit desires.” So these are the processes for purification.\nThe next item is jïäna-yoga-vyavasthiti: being engaged in the cultivation of\nknowledge. Sannyäsé life is meant for distributing knowledge to the\nhouseholders and others who have forgotten their real life of spiritual\nadvancement. A sannyäsé is supposed to beg from door to door for his",
  "livelihood, but this does not mean that he is a beggar. Humility is also one of\nthe qualifications of a transcendentally situated person, and out of sheer\nhumility the sannyäsé goes from door to door, not exactly for the purpose of\nbegging, but to see the householders and awaken them to Kåñëa consciousness.\nThis is the duty of a sannyäsé. If he is actually advanced and so ordered by his\nspiritual master, he should preach Kåñëa consciousness with logic and",
  "understanding, and if one is not so advanced he should not accept the\nrenounced order of life. But even if one has accepted the renounced order of\nlife without sufficient knowledge, he should engage himself fully in hearing",
  "Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.\nfrom a bona fide spiritual master to cultivate knowledge. A sannyäsé, or one in\nthe renounced order of life, must be situated in fearlessness, sattva-saàçuddhi\n(purity) and jïäna-yoga (knowledge).\nThe next item is charity. Charity is meant for the householders. The\nhouseholders should earn a livelihood by an honorable means and spend fifty\npercent of their income to propagate Kåñëa consciousness all over the world.",
  "Thus a householder should give in charity to institutional societies that are\nengaged in that way. Charity should be given to the right receiver. There are\ndifferent kinds of charity, as will be explained later on—charity in the modes\nof goodness, passion and ignorance. Charity in the mode of goodness is\nrecommended by the scriptures, but charity in the modes of passion and\nignorance is not recommended, because it is simply a waste of money. Charity",
  "should be given only to propagate Kåñëa consciousness all over the world. That\nis charity in the mode of goodness.\nThen as far as dama (self-control) is concerned, it is not only meant for\nother orders of religious society, but is especially meant for the householder.\nAlthough he has a wife, a householder should not use his senses for sex life\nunnecessarily. There are restrictions for the householders even in sex life,",
  "which should only be engaged in for the propagation of children. If he does not\nrequire children, he should not enjoy sex life with his wife. Modern society\nenjoys sex life with contraceptive methods or more abominable methods to\navoid the responsibility of children. This is not in the transcendental quality,\nbut is demoniac. If anyone, even if he is a householder, wants to make progress\nin spiritual life, he must control his sex life and should not beget a child",
  "without the purpose of serving Kåñëa. If he is able to beget children who will\nbe in Kåñëa consciousness, one can produce hundreds of children, but without\nthis capacity one should not indulge only for sense pleasure.\nSacrifice is another item to be performed by the householders, because\nsacrifices require a large amount of money. Those in other orders of life,\nnamely brahmacarya, vänaprastha and sannyäsa, have no money; they live by",
  "begging. So performance of different types of sacrifice is meant for the\nhouseholders. They should perform agni-hotra sacrifices as enjoined in the\nVedic literature, but such sacrifices at the present moment are very expensive,",
  "Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.\nand it is not possible for any householder to perform them. The best sacrifice\nrecommended in this age is called saìkértana-yajïa. This saìkértana-yajïa, the\nchanting of Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma,\nHare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare, is the best and most inexpensive\nsacrifice; everyone can adopt it and derive benefit. So these three items,",
  "namely charity, sense control and performance of sacrifice, are meant for the\nhouseholder.\nThen svädhyäya, Vedic study, is meant for brahmacarya, or student life.\nBrahmacärés should have no connection with women; they should live a life of\ncelibacy and engage the mind in the study of Vedic literature for cultivation of\nspiritual knowledge. This is called svädhyäya.\nTapas, or austerity, is especially meant for the retired life. One should not",
  "remain a householder throughout his whole life; he must always remember that\nthere are four divisions of life—brahmacarya, gåhastha, vänaprastha and\nsannyäsa. So after gåhastha, householder life, one should retire. If one lives for\na hundred years, he should spend twenty-five years in student life, twenty-five\nin householder life, twenty-five in retired life and twenty-five in the\nrenounced order of life. These are the regulations of the Vedic religious",
  "discipline. A man retired from household life must practice austerities of the\nbody, mind and tongue. That is tapasya. The entire varëäçrama-dharma society\nis meant for tapasya. Without tapasya, or austerity, no human being can get\nliberation. The theory that there is no need of austerity in life, that one can go\non speculating and everything will be nice, is recommended neither in the\nVedic literature nor in Bhagavad-gétä. Such theories are manufactured by",
  "show-bottle spiritualists who are trying to gather more followers. If there are\nrestrictions, rules and regulations, people will not become attracted. Therefore\nthose who want followers in the name of religion, just to have a show only,\ndon’t restrict the lives of their students, nor their own lives. But that method is\nnot approved by the Vedas.\nAs far as the brahminical quality of simplicity is concerned, not only should",

One\nshould not think that since the spirit spark is never killed even after the\nkilling of the body there is no harm in killing animals for sense gratification.\nPeople are now addicted to eating animals, in spite of having an ample supply\nof grains, fruits and milk. There is no necessity for animal killing. This",
  "injunction is for everyone. When there is no alternative, one may kill an\nanimal, but it should be offered in sacrifice. At any rate, when there is an\nample food supply for humanity, persons who are desiring to make\nadvancement in spiritual realization should not commit violence to animals.\nReal ahiàsä means not checking anyone’s progressive life. The animals are also\nmaking progress in their evolutionary life by transmigrating from one category",
  "of animal life to another. If a particular animal is killed, then his progress is\nchecked. If an animal is staying in a particular body for so many days or so\nmany years and is untimely killed, then he has to come back again in that form\nof life to complete the remaining days in order to be promoted to another\nspecies of life. So their progress should not be checked simply to satisfy one’s\npalate. This is called ahiàsä.\nSatyam. This word means that one should not distort the truth for some",

This is the\nverdict of the Eighteenth Chapter.\nFrom Bhagavad-gétä we can understand that to realize oneself by",

  "Material energy is manifested into twenty-four divisions. The creation is\neffected by eternal time, and it is created and dissolved by external energy.\nThis manifestation of the cosmic world repeatedly becomes visible and\ninvisible.\nIn Bhagavad-gétä five principal subject matters have been discussed: the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, material nature, the living entities, eternal\ntime and all kinds of activities.

But the Supreme is always different\nfrom everything. Lord Caitanya’s philosophy is that of “inconceivable oneness",
  "and difference.” This system of philosophy constitutes perfect knowledge of\nthe Absolute Truth.\nThe living entity in his original position is pure spirit. He is just like an\natomic particle of the Supreme Spirit. Thus Lord Kåñëa may be compared to\nthe sun, and the living entities to sunshine. Because the living entities are the\nmarginal energy of Kåñëa, they have a tendency to be in contact either with\nthe material energy or with the spiritual energy. In other words, the living",

By\nproper use of that independence he comes under the direct order of Kåñëa.\nThus he attains his normal condition in the pleasure-giving potency.\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Eighteenth Chapter of the Çrémad\nBhagavad-gétä in the matter of its Conclusion—the Perfection of Renunciation."
